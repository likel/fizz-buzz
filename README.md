# fizz-buzz
This is my first repository to test the features of GitHub.

## Task

The task, requested by potential software employers, is to write a program which prints numbers from 1 to 100 with the following conditions:
* multiples of 3 print "Fizz" instead of the number
* multiples of 5 print "Buzz" instead of the number
* multiples of 3 & 5 print "FizzBuzz"
